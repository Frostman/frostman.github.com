excerpt: A short story about how to create HTML5 presentation with landslide framework.
---

Few days ago I encountered a problem with making presentation for techtalk. I didn't want to use Microsoft PowerPoint
or presentations in Google Docs, because I want to publish slides in my blog. So, it had to be an html5
application and also it had to be ready to be used in browser with projector.

I found some interesting tool to do it. Enjoy it: [LandSlide](https://github.com/n1k0/landslide).

The sample presentation with features overview you can find [here](http://adamzap.com/random/landslide.html#slide1).
Use **&larr;** and **&rarr;** to browse slides.
