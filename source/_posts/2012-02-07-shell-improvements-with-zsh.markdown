First of all, I want to say that the most part of materials for this article I found in the internet.
This is an agregation of usefull tips for zsh.

Here is my *.zshrc* file:
{% gist 1754521 %}

There are a lot of terminal's improvements, such as extended autocompletion and forced rehash.
I use this configuration at Ubuntu 11.10 and Mac OS X 10.7.3.
You can activate autocompletion by *Tab* button and control it by arrow keys.
It works with files, directories and hosts.

I don't have much experience in configuring zsh, but feel free to ask me about something you are intersting in.

P.S. Some screen shots of my terminal:
