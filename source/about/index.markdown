This is a personal blog by Sergey Lukjanov. I will write about Java, Kotlin, Scala, Groovy, JavaScript, Python languages, 
about Spring, GWT, Javassist, ASM, Swing, Netty, Gretty, KnockoutJS, JQuery, Tornado, SQLAlchemy frameworks,
about some tips for OS X 
and about some personal open source projects. 

You can find my Github and Twitter accouts and mailto link at the navigation line.

It is my first personal blog and I hope that you find it interesting.
